/*what is data structure ? what are wearies types of data structure*/
/*ans- a data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data .
it is a way of arranging data on computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiency

data structure- data structure are an integral part of computer used for the arrangement of data in memory

 /* TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURE
 1)LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE:-data structure in which data element are arranged sequentially or linearly, 
 where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent element is called a linear data structure
 
 2)STATIC DATA STRUCTURE:-static data structure has a fixed memory size 
 it is easier to access the element in a static data structure
 an example of this data structure is array
 
 3)DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURE:- in the dynamic data structure 
 the size is not fixed in can be randomly updated during the runtime
 which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space)complexity of the code */
